This project implements a file management and monitoring system using Python and the watchdog library. 
It monitors a specified directory for file changes, including additions and modifications. 
The system categorizes files based on their extension and moves them to designated folders (e.g., images, PDFs, videos). 
Includes handling for both existing and new files with logging for successful operations and errors.
